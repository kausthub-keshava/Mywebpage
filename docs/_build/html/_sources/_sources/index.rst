Making modification to the main webpage:

"If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one... I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds."

This verse is spoken by Lord Krishna, who reveals his universal form to the prince Arjuna, displaying his full spiritual realization and power. The Bhagavad Gita itself is a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. It covers a broad range of spiritual topics, including duty, righteousness, and devotion.
